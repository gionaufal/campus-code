## What is this?
This is an app to register and show translation cards. It can be used by any establishment that needs to have specific words translated quickly. 

## Is it more useful than Google Translate, for example?
Probably not. 

## So, why did you make it?
This was made as an exercise of Campus Code, a Rails Bootcamp based in SÃ£o Paulo/BR, specifically to practice the basic concepts of Ruby on Rails, such as the MVC paradigm and CRUD requests.
